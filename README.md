# End Portal Finder

Hello! This is my app for quick searching portals in game Minecraft using Parallax method. Currently my app is in alpha version.
It works, but I am going to add some features before I publish it to Google Play.
If you want to improve the app, you can help me by making a pull request.

Things I want to add:
- Usage guide so people won't be confused on how they are going to use the app.
- Explanatory material about how does the app work for those who are interested.

-----Ready to be published------

- Improved search algorhytm that uses more than two points based on the Least Squares method.
- Visual representation of Parallax method, found portal and search area.
